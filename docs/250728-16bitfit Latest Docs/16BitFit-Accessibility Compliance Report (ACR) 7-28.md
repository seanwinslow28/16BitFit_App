### **1\. Commitment & Goal**

* **Statement of Intent:** 16BitFit is committed to providing an inclusive and accessible experience for all users, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities. We believe that everyone deserves a fun and motivating way to pursue their fitness goals.  
* **Compliance Target:** Our goal is to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standard where applicable to a mobile application. This document outlines our strategy for achieving this target for the MVP and future versions.

### **2\. Visual Accessibility (For Low Vision & Colorblind Users)**

* **Challenge:** The retro, low-contrast Game Boy aesthetic, while core to our brand, can present challenges for users with visual impairments.  
* **Solutions:**  
  * **High-Contrast Mode:**  
    * **Requirement:** A toggle in the settings menu will enable a "High-Contrast Mode."  
    * **Implementation:** This mode will override the standard Game Boy shell palette (\#C4BEBB, \#545454) with a simple black (\#000000) and white (\#FFFFFF) theme for all UI elements, ensuring maximum readability for text and buttons. The core "Green Screen" game content will remain unchanged, but its surrounding UI will be high-contrast.  
  * **Dynamic Type & Font Scaling:**  
    * **Requirement:** All UI text must respect the user's system-level font size settings.  
    * **Implementation:** Use relative font sizes and ensure UI layouts are flexible enough to accommodate larger text without breaking or overlapping.  
  * **Screen Reader Support (VoiceOver/TalkBack):**  
    * **Requirement:** All interactive elements (buttons, sliders, input fields) must be properly labeled for screen readers.  
    * **Implementation:** Add accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint props to all React Native components. For example, the "Battle" button will be labeled "Battle. Button. Takes you to the battle menu."  
  * **Colorblind-Friendly Design:**  
    * **Requirement:** Information conveyed by color must also be available through another visual means (text, icons, patterns).  
    * **Implementation:** While our primary buttons use color, they also use distinct icons (e.g., ‚öîÔ∏è for Battle, üí™ for Train). Stat bars will have clear text labels. We will avoid using color as the *only* way to distinguish between elements.

### **3\. Auditory Accessibility (For Deaf & Hard-of-Hearing Users)**

* **Challenge:** The app uses sound effects to provide feedback for user actions and game events.  
* **Solutions:**  
  * **Redundant Visual Feedback:**  
    * **Requirement:** Every audio cue must be accompanied by a clear and simultaneous visual cue.  
    * **Implementation:**  
      * SFX\_Stat\_Increase: Accompanied by the stat bar animating and a "+5" text appearing.  
      * SFX\_Hit\_Heavy: Accompanied by a large, flashing "hit spark" visual effect.  
      * SFX\_Achievement: Accompanied by a pop-up notification or banner.  
  * **Device Vibration (Haptics):**  
    * **Requirement:** Use haptic feedback for critical game events.  
    * **Implementation:** A short vibration will occur when taking damage in a battle or when a significant achievement is unlocked.

### **4\. Motor Accessibility (For Users with Limited Dexterity)**

* **Challenge:** The fighting game requires quick taps on specific on-screen controls.  
* **Solutions:**  
  * **Large Touch Targets:**  
    * **Requirement:** All buttons and interactive UI elements must meet or exceed Apple's and Google's recommended minimum touch target size (e.g., 44x44 points).  
    * **Implementation:** Ensure that even if a button *looks* small, its tappable area is large enough to be easily pressed without error.  
  * **Simplified Interactions:**  
    * **Requirement:** The core meta-game loop (logging activities) must be achievable with simple taps and require no complex gestures like "long press" or "drag and drop."  
  * **Future Consideration (Post-MVP):**  
    * **Control Customization:** Explore options for allowing users to resize and reposition the on-screen fighting game controls in a future version.

### **5\. Cognitive Accessibility (For Users with Learning or Attention Differences)**

* **Challenge:** Games can sometimes be overwhelming or have unclear objectives.  
* **Solutions:**  
  * **Clear & Simple Language:**  
    * **Requirement:** All text in the app will use clear, concise, and straightforward language. Avoid jargon where possible.  
  * **Consistent Layout & Navigation:**  
    * **Requirement:** The placement of primary navigation and core action buttons will remain consistent across all screens to ensure predictability.  
  * **On-Demand Help:**  
    * **Requirement:** The "Training Dummy" boss serves as a permanent, risk-free tutorial for the combat system, allowing users to practice at their own pace.  
  * **Distraction-Free Focus:**  
    * **Requirement:** During the fighting game, no non-critical notifications or animations will occur, allowing the user to focus fully on the battle.
