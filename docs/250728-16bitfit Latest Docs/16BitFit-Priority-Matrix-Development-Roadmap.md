# 16BitFit Comprehensive Priority Matrix & Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of all project documentation, the 16BitFit project faces critical infrastructure gaps that must be addressed before the Phaser 3 migration can succeed. The backend is not properly configured, authentication is using placeholder credentials, and real-time features are missing. This roadmap prioritizes fixing these foundational issues while maintaining momentum on the Phaser 3 fighting game integration.

## Critical Path Requirements

1. **Supabase Configuration**: Project using placeholder credentials
2. **Database Deployment**: Schema exists but not deployed
3. **Authentication System**: Non-functional without valid credentials
4. **Real-time Infrastructure**: Missing for multiplayer features
5. **WebView Performance**: Unvalidated 60fps target

### âš¡ High Priority (Core MVP Features)
1. **Phaser 3 WebView Integration**: Core fighting game
2. **5-Stage Evolution System**: Character progression
3. **Activity Logging**: Fitness tracking functionality
4. **Boss Battle System**: 6 unique bosses with AI
5. **Onboarding Flow**: 60-second guest experience

### ðŸŽ¯ Medium Priority (Enhancement Features)
1. **Sound System**: 80+ retro SFX integration
2. **Analytics Integration**: PostHog tracking
3. **Stat Calculations**: Fitness to combat stat conversion
4. **Evolution Ceremony**: Visual transformation sequences
5. **Achievement System**: Progress tracking

### ðŸ“‹ Low Priority (Post-MVP)
1. **Social Features**: Leaderboards, profiles
2. **PvP System**: Asynchronous battles
3. **Guild System**: Team features
4. **Advanced Nutrition**: Macro tracking
5. **Super Combos**: Advanced combat mechanics

   - Resolution: Use `boss_battles` for PvE, reserve `battles` for future PvP
   
2. **Authentication Approach**
   - PRD: Guest-only onboarding
   - TDD: Full authentication system
   - Resolution: Implement guest auth first, full system post-MVP

3. **Analytics Implementation**
   - Multiple tracking approaches mentioned
   - Resolution: Standardize on PostHog for all events

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **TODAY (Priority Order)**
   - Backend Specialist: Create Supabase project
   - DevOps Specialist: Set up environment configs
   - Phaser3 Specialist: Create WebView prototype
   - Game Dev: Review combat requirements
   - Performance: Set up profiling tools

2. **This Week Critical Path**
   - Get backend functional (Days 1-2)
   - Prove WebView concept (Days 3-4)
   - Start combat prototype (Days 5-7)
