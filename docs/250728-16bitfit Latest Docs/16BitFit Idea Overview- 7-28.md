**16BitFit**  
Overall idea  
Retro arcade style fitness app with a main avatar that has 5 evolution stages. Similar to an evolving Pokémon. The more experience, the better the stats get and it evolves into a superior Pokémon.   
**Avatar Evolution States (All Users)**  
**Total: 5 Stages**

**1\.** 🧍 **Basic**

**Unlock Condition:** First time user joins the app  
 **Visual Style:**

* Slouched or neutral posture  
* Lean body type, no visible muscle definition  
* Wears basic gym clothes. Loose fitting.  
* Expression is neutral or slightly unsure  
* Arms hang loosely at the sides  
* Movements are minimal — idle breathing, looking around nervously

**2\.** 🏃 **Intermediate**

**Unlock Condition:** Achieved 10 days of logged workouts  
 **Visual Style:**

* Upright posture with hints of confidence  
* Slightly more defined muscles (arms, chest)  
* Facial expression is alert and focused

* Hair may look more styled or dynamic

* Ready-for-action stance: weight shifted slightly forward

**3\.** 💪 **Advanced**

**Unlock Condition:** 30 days of logged workouts  
 **Visual Style:**

* Noticeably muscular and toned physique

* Sleeveless gym top or tank top with visible arm definition

* Confident smirk or determined expression

* Power stance: feet shoulder-width apart, fists subtly clenched

**4\.** 🔥 **Master**

**Unlock Condition:** 50 days of logged workouts  
 **Visual Style:**

* Heroic posture — shoulders back, chest out, chin raised

* Aura glow or energy trails (for special frames)

* Clearly the leader of the gym — combat-ready yet composed

* Defined jawline, intense eyes

**5\.** 👑 **Legend**

**Unlock Condition:** 100-days of logged workouts  
 **Visual Style:**

* Final evolution; design inspired by anime boss transformations or Street Fighter final forms

* Perfect form — exaggerated musculature, god-like symmetry

* Glowing eyes or battle aura always present

* Floating particles, electricity, fire, or wind effects around character

In order to have their avatar grow and advance, the user will log their workouts and food intake. When they log healthy foods and log workouts, then the stats of the avatar go up. If they log unhealthy foods, skip workouts, or don’t log at all, the avatars stats slowly go down and when it reaches a critical low point in their stats, the avatar changes to an avatar that looks sick/tired/sluggish. After 10 days of logged workouts, the avatar evolves to level 2\. After 30 days of logged workouts, they evolve to level 3\. After 50 days of logged workouts, they evolve to level 4\. After 100 days of logged workouts, they evolve to level 5\.   
This all pays off because the more you workout and eat healthy, the better your stats become. Which carries over to the boss battles stages.   
The boss battle stages will be where your character uses its updated stats to fight a boss. For the MVP, there will be a simple training dummy to understand game mechanics and 5 bosses:   
1)TrainingDummy \- Easy start to understand game mechanics. Not difficult at all  
2)Procrastination Phantom \- unlocked after 5 workouts  
3\) Sloth Demon  \- unlocked after 15 workouts  
**4\)**Gym Bully \- unlocked after 30 workouts  
5)Stress Titan \- unlocked after 45 workouts  
6)Ultimate Slump \- unlocked after 60 workouts  
I will add more boss battles as the app progresses, but to start, these will be the 5\.   
The game mechanics of this will be the same as SNES Street fighter 2, but tied to the theme of 16BitFit fitness:   
1\. The Fundamental Loop: Rounds, Health, and Timer  
2\. The Six-Button Control Scheme  
3\. Movement and Positioning (Zoning)  
4\. Defense: Blocking and Chip Damage  
5\. Special Moves: The Iconic Attacks  
6\. Throws / Grapples  
7\. Combos: Linking and Cancelling  
8\. Dizzy / Stun State  
9\. Super Combos (*from Super SFII Turbo*)
