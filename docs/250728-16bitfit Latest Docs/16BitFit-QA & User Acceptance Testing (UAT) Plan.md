### **1\. Testing Philosophy & Goals**

* **Philosophy:** Our approach to quality assurance is proactive and continuous. Testing is not a final phase but an integral part of the entire development process. Our goal is to identify and resolve issues as early as possible to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for our users.  
* **Primary Goal:** To validate that the 16BitFit MVP meets all functional requirements outlined in the PRD, is free of critical or major bugs, and provides a fun, performant, and motivating user experience on target devices.

### **2\. Testing Phases**

* **Phase 1: Unit & Integration Testing (Continuous)**  
  * **Who:** Development Team.  
  * **What:**  
    * **Unit Tests:** Code-level tests to verify that individual functions and components work as expected (e.g., does the calculateStatIncrease function return the correct value?).  
    * **Integration Tests:** Tests to ensure that different parts of the app work together correctly (e.g., does logging a workout correctly save the data to the backend *and* update the UI on the Home Screen?).  
* **Phase 2: Internal QA Testing (Pre-Release)**  
  * **Who:** The internal project team (Product, Design, Dev).  
  * **What:** A thorough, end-to-end test of the complete application based on the detailed test cases below. This phase focuses on validating user flows, functionality, and the overall user experience.  
* **Phase 3: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (1-2 Weeks Before Launch)**  
  * **Who:** A small group of external testers recruited from our target audience.  
  * **What:** Testers will be given the app and a set of tasks to complete (e.g., "Complete the onboarding and defeat the Training Dummy"). They will provide feedback on usability, fun factor, and any bugs they encounter. This is our final "real-world" check.

### **3\. Bug Reporting & Triage Process**

1. **Reporting:** All bugs will be reported in a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) with a clear title, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and a screenshot/video.  
2. **Triage:** The project lead will review new bugs and assign a priority level:  
   * **P0 (Critical):** App crashing, data loss, security vulnerabilities. Blocks release. Must be fixed immediately.  
   * **P1 (High):** Major feature not working as intended, significant UI/UX issue. Must be fixed before launch.  
   * **P2 (Medium):** Minor feature issue or moderate UI problem that doesn't block a user's progress. Can potentially be fixed in a patch shortly after launch.  
   * **P3 (Low):** Cosmetic issue, typo, or other minor imperfection. Addressed when time permits.

### **4\. MVP Test Cases**

*This is a checklist for the Internal QA and UAT phases.*

#### **Onboarding & First-Time Use**

* **TC-ON-01:** Verify that a new user can complete the entire onboarding flow (Welcome \-\> Archetype \-\> Log \-\> Home) without errors.  
* **TC-ON-02:** Verify that after onboarding, the "Battle" button on the Home Screen is highlighted and the coach tip is visible.  
* **TC-ON-03:** Verify that skipping the onboarding flow takes the user directly to the Home Screen with a default character.

#### **Core Activity Logging**

* **TC-LOG-01:** Verify that logging a "Strength" workout correctly increases the Strength and Stamina stats.  
* **TC-LOG-02:** Verify that logging a "Healthy Meal" correctly increases the Health stat.  
* **TC-LOG-03:** Verify that logging "Junk Food" correctly decreases the Health and Stamina stats.  
* **TC-LOG-04:** Verify that after logging any activity, the character on the Home Screen performs the correct positive or negative animation.

#### **Avatar Evolution & Progression**

* **TC-EVO-01:** Verify that after logging the 10th workout, the Evolution Ceremony triggers automatically.  
* **TC-EVO-02:** Verify that after the ceremony, the user's avatar on the Home Screen correctly displays the "Intermediate" stage sprite.  
* **TC-EVO-03:** Verify that all stat increases from the evolution are correctly applied and saved.

#### **Battle System (Phaser 3 WebView)**

* **TC-BTL-01 (Critical Performance):** Verify that the battle against the Training Dummy maintains a consistent 60fps on a mid-range test device.  
* **TC-BTL-02:** Verify that the player's in-game health and damage output directly reflect the stats passed from the React Native client.  
* **TC-BTL-03:** Verify that all on-screen controls (D-Pad, Attack Buttons) are responsive and trigger the correct actions in-game.  
* **TC-BTL-04:** Verify that landing a 3-hit combo is possible and registers correctly.  
* **TC-BTL-05:** Verify that blocking an attack correctly prevents damage.  
* **TC-BTL-06:** Verify that defeating the Training Dummy sends a "win" message back to the React Native client and the user is navigated away from the battle screen.

#### **Accessibility (Based on ACR)**

* **TC-ACC-01:** Verify that enabling "High-Contrast Mode" in settings changes the UI to the black and white theme.  
* **TC-ACC-02:** Verify that all buttons and interactive elements are clearly announced by VoiceOver/TalkBack.  
* **TC-ACC-03:** Verify that every sound effect has a corresponding visual cue on screen.

### **5\. UAT Participant Profile**

*We will recruit 5-10 external testers for the UAT phase. The ideal candidate matches our primary persona:*

* **Age:** 25-40.  
* **Interests:** Has experience with and nostalgia for 16-bit era video games, particularly fighting games.  
* **Goal:** Is looking for a new way to get motivated for fitness.  
* **Technical:** Is comfortable using mobile apps and providing clear, constructive feedback.
