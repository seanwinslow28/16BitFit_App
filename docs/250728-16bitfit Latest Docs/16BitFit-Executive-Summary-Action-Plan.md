# 16BitFit Executive Summary & Action Plan

## Project Status: CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required

### The Situation
16BitFit has world-class documentation and vision but faces critical implementation gaps. The backend infrastructure is non-functional, using placeholder credentials. The Phaser 3 migration hasn't started. Without immediate action, the MVP timeline is at severe risk.

## Top 5 Critical Actions (Next 48 Hours)

### 1. Backend Emergency Setup (Backend Specialist + DevOps)
```bash
# TODAY - Hour 1-2
- Create actual Supabase project
- Generate real API keys
- Update .env with real credentials
- Deploy initial database schema
```

### 2. Phaser 3 Proof of Concept (Phaser3 Specialist + Game Dev)
```bash
# TODAY - Hour 3-6
- Create WebView container
- Load basic Phaser scene
- Test 60fps rendering
- Document performance baseline
```

### 3. Asset Delivery Sprint (Avatar Evolution Specialist)
```bash
# TODAY - Hour 1-4
- Export Stage 1 character sprites
- Create sprite sheet template
- Deliver to Phaser team
- Document asset pipeline
```

### 4. Fix Authentication (Backend Specialist)
```bash
# TOMORROW - Hour 1-3
- Implement guest authentication
- Test user creation flow
- Enable data persistence
- Document auth flow
```

### 5. Establish Daily Standups (Product Manager)
```bash
# TODAY - Immediate
- 9 AM daily standup mandatory
- 15 minutes maximum
- Format: Yesterday/Today/Blockers
- GitHub Issues thread
```
