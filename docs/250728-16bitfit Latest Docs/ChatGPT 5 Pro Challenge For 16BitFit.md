Deliverables Required:

Complete Component Library: Production-ready React Native components using designTokens.js

Pixel-Perfect Implementation: Exact Game Boy color palette (\#9BBC0F, \#8BAC0F, \#306230, \#0F380F) with PressStart2P typography

Animation Systems: 60fps UI animations using react-native-reanimated

Responsive Design: Cross-platform compatibility with haptic feedback integration

Specific Components to Build:

StatCard with animated progress bars

PixelAvatar with 12x12 grid system

EvolutionCeremony with full-screen takeover effects

BattleMenuScreen extracted from AppV2.js with pixel-style buttons

Innovation Challenge: Design the "Evolution Ceremony" experience that creates the "Super Saiyan moment" Gemini described. Make users want to share their transformation.

Quality Standard: Your components should be so well-designed that other developers would use them as reference implementations.

📊 EXECUTION CHALLENGE \#3: USER PSYCHOLOGY OPTIMIZATION

Challenge: Implement the "Dual Progression System"

Gemini identified that we need to reward both Consistency (fitness) and Mastery (gaming skill). Make it work.

Deliverables Required:

Algorithm Design: Mathematical formulas for the dual progression system

Database Schema: Complete PostgreSQL schema for tracking both progression types

User Flow Implementation: Detailed screens and transitions for the progression experience

Engagement Hooks: Specific mechanics for the "Momentum Buff" system

Psychology Requirements:

Appeal to both "Retro Gamer Ryan" and "Goal-Oriented Gina" personas

60-second onboarding that hooks users immediately

Social sharing mechanics that drive viral growth

Long-term retention through authentic skill development

Breakthrough Challenge: Design engagement mechanics that make fitness feel like competitive gaming without compromising the authenticity of either experience.

🚀 EXECUTION CHALLENGE \#4: DEVELOPMENT VELOCITY OPTIMIZATION

Challenge: Coordinate 17 AI Specialists for Maximum Development Speed

You have access to the complete specialist team. Orchestrate them perfectly.

Deliverables Required:

90-Day Implementation Roadmap: Sprint-by-sprint breakdown with dependencies

Specialist Coordination Matrix: Exact handoff protocols and parallel work streams

Quality Gates: Automated testing and performance validation systems

Risk Mitigation: Contingency plans for technical and market challenges

Team Coordination Requirements:

Organize specialists into the "Cross-Functional Pods" Gemini suggested

Define the critical path through Phaser3 Integration Specialist

Create automated performance gates for 60fps requirement

Establish documentation and knowledge management systems

Innovation Challenge: Design a development workflow that could become the industry standard for AI-assisted app development.

💰 EXECUTION CHALLENGE \#5: MONETIZATION & MARKET DOMINANCE

Challenge: Execute the "FGC Trojan Horse" Strategy

Gemini identified the Fighting Game Community as critical for credibility. Make it happen.

Deliverables Required:

Go-to-Market Execution Plan: Specific influencer targets, content strategies, partnerships

Monetization Implementation: Complete economic system for cosmetics, league passes, sponsored gear

Viral Mechanics: Social sharing systems and community building features

Competitive Ecosystem: Tournament systems and ranking algorithms

Market Requirements:

Position as authentic fighting game, not fitness gamification

Appeal to both fitness and gaming communities without alienating either

Create sustainable revenue without pay-to-win mechanics

Build systems that could support millions of users

Business Challenge: Design revenue streams that enhance rather than undermine the core fitness motivation.

🧠 META-CHALLENGE: BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION

Beyond Implementation: Don't just execute the current vision—improve it.

Innovation Opportunities:

Technical Breakthroughs: What performance optimizations could push mobile gaming further?

UX Innovations: What interaction patterns could redefine fitness app engagement?

Business Model Innovation: What monetization strategies could create new market dynamics?

Social Features: What community mechanics could drive explosive growth?

Platform Extensions: How could this expand to AR/VR, console, or other platforms?
