**Phase 1**

You're helping me prototype a React Native (Expo) home screen for my app \*\*16BitFit\*\*. It's styled like a \*\*GameBoy\*\* game but with \*\*Apple-style modern polish\*\* ‚Äî pixel art meets sleek clarity.  
Design Goals:  
\- 16-bit retro game aesthetic (NES/GameBoy Color)  
\- Clean, modern layout (Apple-style grid, spacing, contrast)  
\- Uses \`Press Start 2P\` font for pixel text  
\- All buttons and containers should be pixel-styled (NES.css or Tailwind-like if needed)  
\- Background is dark (\#0D0D0D), with green GameBoy tint (\#9BBC0F) in main game window  
\- Retro-style scanline effect overlay  
\- Uses placeholder character sprite for now (64x64px)  
Please generate a fully functional \*\*React Native JSX layout prototype\*\* for this Home Screen.  
\---  
\#\#\# üì± Layout Structure  
\- App Shell container (retro border \+ shadows)  
\- Top Header Bar with ‚Äú16BIT FIT‚Äù logo  
\- Character Arena (mid-screen):  
    \- Green-tinted game window (\#9BBC0F)  
    \- Scanline overlay (repeating linear gradient)  
    \- Character sprite in the center  
\- Stat meters (energy \+ motivation bars) stacked below sprite  
\- Two main action buttons:  
    \- WORKOUT (green primary)  
    \- EAT HEALTHY (green primary)  
\- Bottom nav bar with 3 nav buttons: STATS, BATTLE, HOME  
\---  
\#\#\# üì¶ Layout Containers (Retro-Modern Style)  
\- \`.screen-container\`: black background, rounded pixel border, inner shadow  
\- \`.game-window\`: green tint background, border, scanline overlay using \`repeating-linear-gradient\`  
\- \`.character-arena\`: vertically centered flex container  
\- \`.stat-bar\`: 200x16px progress bar with black border, pixel fill, color variants  
    \- \`health-red\`: \#E53935  
    \- \`energy-orange\`: \#FB8C00  
    \- \`primary-green\`: \#92CC41  
\---  
\#\#\# üéÆ Buttons  
\- WORKOUT / EAT HEALTHY: square-edged, green background (\#92CC41), black text, 4px black border, inset shadow when pressed  
\- Nav buttons: STATS / BATTLE / HOME  
    \- yellow (\#F7D51D) pixel font on black background  
    \- pixel icons optional (e.g., heart, sword, home)  
\---  
Please generate the full \*\*React Native component JSX\*\* using inline styles or Tailwind-style classnames. Do not generate dummy logic or APIs ‚Äî just layout and styling structure. Use placeholder sprites and bar values for now.

After you‚Äôve completed these steps, please let me know before you move on to Phase 2, so I can review your work and see if I‚Äôd like to make any changes. 

**PHASE 2**

You're helping me build the next section of my app UI for \*\*16BitFit\*\*, a retro-modern GameBoy-style fitness game that looks like it was designed by \*\*Steve Jobs and Nintendo\*\* in 2025\.  
This prompt focuses on three elements:  
1\. Stat Bars & Progress Meters  
2\. Pixel Iconography  
3\. Animations & Feedback FX  
Use a mix of \*\*pixel-perfect NES-style graphics\*\* and \*\*modern UI structure\*\*. Layout should remain grid-aligned and responsive to mobile portrait screens.  
\---  
\#\#\# üìä Stat Bars & Progress Meters  
Create 5 horizontal bars stacked vertically with label \+ pixel icon:  
\- ‚ù§Ô∏è \*\*Health\*\*: Red bar (\#E53935)  
\- ‚ö° \*\*Energy\*\*: Orange bar (\#FB8C00)  
\- üí™ \*\*Strength\*\*: Yellow bar (\#F7D51D)  
\- üòÄ \*\*Motivation\*\*: Green bar (\#92CC41)  
\- üåü \*\*EXP\*\*: Blue gradient bar with floating star at end (\#2C76C8)  
Each bar should:  
\- Be 200px wide, 16px tall  
\- Use a thick black border (2px) with pixelated interior  
\- Display label and icon on the left (icon: 16x16, label in \`Press Start 2P\`)  
\- Support 3 visual states: default, hover (glow), pressed (inset)  
Use clean flex or grid layout with spacing between rows.  
\---  
\#\#\# üß© Iconography  
Use 16x16 pixel icons for:  
\- Heart (health)  
\- Lightning bolt (energy)  
\- Dumbbell or muscle arm (strength)  
\- Smiley face (motivation)  
\- Star (EXP)  
\- Burger (junk food)  
\- Salad (healthy food)  
\- Chart bar (progress screen)  
\- Sword (battle)  
\- Home (navigation)  
Each icon should have 3 states:  
\- Default: pixel filled icon with black outline  
\- Active: glowing or sparkle effect  
\- Disabled: grayscale desaturation  
Use these icons inline next to their relevant stat bar or button.  
\---  
\#\#\# ‚ú® Animations & Effects  
Simulate sprite-sheet or CSS animation classes (you can stub these for now). Add the following animations:  
1\. \*\*Level Up Sparkle\*\*    
   \- Yellow radial burst effect (6 frames) on EXP bar fill  
   \- Used on level-up, or when EXP bar reaches 100%  
2\. \*\*Damage Blink\*\*  
   \- Red overlay blink on character or stat bar when a negative action occurs  
   \- 3-frame flash: normal ‚Üí red tint ‚Üí invisible ‚Üí repeat  
3\. \*\*Positive Sparkle\*\*  
   \- Green or yellow sparkle particle that floats upward on healthy action  
   \- Triggered on WORKOUT or EAT HEALTHY  
4\. \*\*Aura Pulse\*\*  
   \- Faint glowing pulse that surrounds character sprite when in high Motivation state  
5\. \*\*Tap Feedback\*\*  
   \- White ring pulse animation for button taps (simulate with animated outline or radial fade)  
Please structure these as reusable React Native components or styled \`View\` blocks with animation placeholders (e.g. \`Animated.View\`, or \`className="aura-pulse"\`). Animations can use class-based names for now like \`.level-up-fx\`, \`.damage-blink\`, etc.  
\---  
üõ† Tech Stack Reminder:  
\- React Native (Expo)  
\- NES.css \+ Tailwind style classnames  
\- \`Press Start 2P\` font  
\- Pixel icons and sprites  
\- Inline styles or utility classes are fine  
Do not generate full logic. Focus only on the JSX layout and styling logic using placeholders where needed.
