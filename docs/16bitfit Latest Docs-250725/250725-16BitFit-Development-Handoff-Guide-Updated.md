**Key Success Metrics:**
- 80% feature completion by day 28 (buffer for testing)
- 60fps fighting game performance on iOS/Android
- <3 second app startup time with character ready for interaction
- Street Fighter-inspired combo system with 4-6 base moves

---

## Section 1: Codebase Refactoring Strategy

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Architecture Strengths:**
- React Native foundation established
- Supabase backend integration functional
- Character stat system (0-100 scale) implemented
- 16-bit UI design system completed

**Identified Refactoring Priorities:**

```javascript
// BEFORE: Complex, nested component structure
const CharacterScreen = () => {
  const [stats, setStats] = useState({});
  const [animations, setAnimations] = useState({});
  const [battles, setBattles] = useState({});
  const [social, setSocial] = useState({});
  
  // 200+ lines of mixed logic
  return <ComplexNestedComponents />
};

// AFTER: Simplified, single-responsibility components
const CharacterScreen = () => {
  const character = useCharacter();
  const animations = useCharacterAnimations();
  
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <CharacterAvatar character={character} animations={animations} />
      <CharacterStats stats={character.stats} />
      <ActionButtons onBattle={() => navigation.navigate('Battle')} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

### Refactoring Phases (Days 1-8)

**Phase 1 (Days 1-2): Core Component Simplification**
```bash
# Claude Code prompting strategy
"Refactor this React Native component to use single-responsibility principle. 
Split complex components into smaller, focused components. 
Remove any unused props and optimize for mobile performance.
Focus on Character display, Activity logging, and Battle initiation only."
```

**Phase 2 (Days 3-4): State Management Consolidation**  
```bash
# Cursor workflow
"Implement React Context for character state management.
Replace multiple useState hooks with single useReducer for character stats.
Ensure state updates from fitness logging immediately reflect in character appearance."
```

**Phase 3 (Days 5-6): Performance Optimization**
```bash
# Claude Code optimization prompt
"Optimize this React Native component for 60fps performance.
Implement React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback where appropriate.
Add object pooling for game entities and animations."
```

**Phase 4 (Days 7-8): Fighting System Integration**
```bash
# MCP Agent utilization
"Using the phaser-fighter-agent guidelines, implement React Native Game Engine 
fighting mechanics with Street Fighter-inspired controls.
Include quarter-circle motions, combo timing, and character-specific movesets."
```

## Section 2: Claude Code Prompting Strategies

### Master Prompt Template for 16BitFit Development

```
CONTEXT: I'm building 16BitFit, a fitness app where logging workouts/nutrition 
transforms your character's stats, which then affects fighting game performance.

CURRENT STATE: [Describe specific component/feature you're working on]

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- React Native with React Native Game Engine
- Supabase backend for character stats
- 60fps fighting game performance required
- Street Fighter-inspired combat mechanics
- Progressive complexity (simple → advanced)

SPECIFIC REQUEST: [Your specific coding task]

CONSTRAINTS:
- Mobile-first optimization
- Beginner-friendly code patterns
- Must integrate with existing character stat system (0-100 scale)
- Performance critical (consider object pooling, memory management)

EXPECTED OUTPUT: Complete, production-ready code with comments explaining 
integration points and performance considerations.
```

### Specialized Prompts by Feature Area

**Character Stats Integration:**
```
"Create a React Native component that displays character stats (health, stamina, strength) 
as visual bars. Stats should update in real-time when user logs activities. 
Include smooth animations and 16-bit aesthetic styling. 
Optimize for 60fps performance with proper memoization."
```

**Fighting Game Mechanics:**
```
"Implement Street Fighter-style quarter-circle motion detection in React Native.
Use React Native Game Engine for physics and collision detection.
Include basic moveset: punch, kick, block, and one special move per character.
Ensure <50ms input response time for competitive fighting game feel."
```

**UI Simplification:**
```
"Refactor this complex React Native screen to follow the progressive disclosure pattern.
Show only essential elements on first visit: character + two action buttons.
Hide advanced features behind contextual reveals and long-press interactions.
Maintain 16-bit GameBoy aesthetic."
```

### Advanced Prompting Patterns

**For Complex Features:**
```
STEP 1: "Break down [complex feature] into 3-4 smaller components"
STEP 2: "Implement component 1 with full error handling and performance optimization"  
STEP 3: "Integrate component 1 with existing character state system"
STEP 4: "Add component 2, ensuring no performance regression"
[Continue iteratively]
```

**For Debugging:**
```
"Analyze this React Native component for performance bottlenecks.
Focus on: unnecessary re-renders, memory leaks, inefficient animations.
Provide specific fixes with before/after code examples.
Ensure solutions maintain 60fps during fighting game sequences."
```

## Section 3: Street Fighter Fighting Mechanics Priority

### Core Combat System Architecture

**Movement System (Week 1 Priority):**
```javascript
// Street Fighter-inspired movement with React Native Game Engine
const MovementSystem = (entities, { input, time }) => {
  const { player } = entities;
  
  // Quarter-circle motion detection
  const motionBuffer = detectQuarterCircle(input.history);
  
  if (motionBuffer.hadoken && input.punch) {
    player.executeSpecialMove('hadoken');
  }
  
  // Basic movement (Street Fighter style)
  if (input.left) player.body.velocity.x = -player.moveSpeed;
  if (input.right) player.body.velocity.x = player.moveSpeed;
  if (input.up && player.canJump) player.body.velocity.y = -player.jumpForce;
  
  return entities;
};
```

**Combat Mechanics (Week 2 Priority):**
```javascript
// Street Fighter combo system
const CombatSystem = (entities, { input, time }) => {
  const { player, enemy } = entities;
  
  // Basic attacks with combo potential
  if (input.punch && !player.isAttacking) {
    const comboWindow = time.current - player.lastAttackTime < 800;
    
    if (comboWindow && player.lastMove === 'punch') {
      player.executeCombo('light-punch-combo');
    } else {
      player.executeMove('light-punch');
    }
  }
  
  // Street Fighter-style special moves
  if (input.quarterCircleForward && input.punch) {
    player.executeSpecialMove('hadoken', { 
      damage: player.characterStats.strength * 0.4,
      energy: 25 
    });
  }
  
  return entities;
};
```

## Section 4: MCP Agent Integration for React Native

### Agent Restructuring Strategy

Your current MCP agents are optimized for Phaser.js but can be adapted for React Native Game Engine:

**Phaser-Fighter-Agent → React-Native-Fighter-Agent:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Phaser.js approach)
class PhaserFighter extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite {
  constructor(scene, x, y) {
    super(scene, x, y, 'fighter');
    this.setPhysics();
  }
}

// AFTER (React Native Game Engine approach)  
const Fighter = {
  body: Matter.Bodies.rectangle(x, y, width, height),
  renderer: <FighterSprite />,
  health: 100,
  moveSpeed: 5,
  characterStats: { /* from Supabase */ }
};
```

**UI-Overlay-Agent Adaptation:**
```javascript
// Adapt GameBoy-style overlays for React Native
const GameBoyOverlay = ({ children, title }) => (
  <View style={styles.gameBoyFrame}>
    <View style={styles.screenBezel}>
      <Text style={styles.pixelTitle}>{title}</Text>
      <View style={styles.gameScreen}>
        {children}
      </View>
    </View>
    <GameBoyControls />
  </View>
);
```
