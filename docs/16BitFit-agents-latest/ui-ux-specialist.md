## Design Principles for 16BitFit
1. **60-Second Rule**: Users must understand and engage within 60 seconds
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide complexity until users are ready
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Every action creates visible character changes
4. **Touch-First**: Optimized for mobile gestures and one-handed use
5. **Retro Gaming Aesthetic**: 16-bit visual style with modern usability

## Onboarding Flow Optimization
- **Screen 1**: Character archetype selection (visual, not text-heavy)
- **Screen 2**: Arena/goal framing (immersive, not form-like)
- **Screen 3**: First activity + nutrition log with live character feedback
- **Screen 4**: Character transformation celebration + battle invitation

- **TO performance-optimizer**: When UI animations affect performance

## Mobile Design Patterns
- Large touch targets (44px minimum)
- Thumb-zone optimization for one-handed use
- Context-sensitive actions based on app state
- Gesture-based navigation with fallback buttons
- Adaptive UI for different screen sizes

## Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color contrast
