## User Behavior Analysis
### Fitness Engagement Patterns
```sql
-- Analyze workout logging patterns and retention correlation
WITH user_workout_patterns AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_workouts,
    COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(logged_at)) as workout_days,
    AVG(duration_minutes) as avg_duration,
    MAX(logged_at) as last_workout,
    MIN(logged_at) as first_workout
  FROM activities 
  WHERE logged_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY user_id
),
retention_analysis AS (
  SELECT 
    wp.*,
    CASE 
      WHEN last_workout >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 'active'
      WHEN last_workout >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '14 days' THEN 'at_risk'
      ELSE 'churned'
    END as retention_status
  FROM user_workout_patterns wp
)
SELECT 
  retention_status,
  COUNT(*) as user_count,
  AVG(total_workouts) as avg_workouts,
  AVG(workout_days) as avg_workout_days,
  AVG(avg_duration) as avg_session_duration
FROM retention_analysis 
GROUP BY retention_status;
```

### Character Progression Impact
- **Stat Growth Rate**: Correlation between real fitness gains and character progression
- **Feature Unlock Timing**: Optimal pacing for new feature introduction
- **Battle Engagement**: Fighting frequency vs. overall app retention
- **Social Feature Adoption**: Community participation impact on retention

## Predictive Analytics Models
### Churn Prediction Model
```python
# Example churn prediction features
churn_features = {
    'user_characteristics': [
        'days_since_install',
        'initial_character_archetype',
        'onboarding_completion_time'
    ],
    'engagement_patterns': [
        'avg_daily_sessions',
        'workout_logging_frequency',
        'battle_participation_rate',
        'social_feature_usage'
    ],
    'progression_metrics': [
        'character_level_growth_rate',
        'achievement_unlock_pace',
        'stat_improvement_consistency'
    ],
    'behavioral_signals': [
        'session_length_trend',
        'feature_exploration_breadth',
        'support_contact_frequency'
    ]
}

# Churn risk scoring
def calculate_churn_risk(user_data):
    risk_score = 0
    
    # Engagement decline indicators
    if user_data['sessions_last_7_days'] < user_data['sessions_previous_7_days'] * 0.5:
        risk_score += 30
    
    # Fitness activity decline
    if user_data['workouts_last_week'] == 0:
        risk_score += 25
    
    # Social disengagement
    if user_data['social_interactions_last_week'] == 0:
        risk_score += 20
    
    return min(risk_score, 100)
```

## A/B Testing Framework
### Experimental Design Templates
```javascript
const experimentTemplates = {
  onboarding_optimization: {
    hypothesis: 'Reducing onboarding screens increases completion rate',
    variants: ['4_screens', '3_screens', '2_screens'],
    primary_metric: 'onboarding_completion_rate',
    secondary_metrics: ['time_to_first_battle', 'day_1_retention'],
    sample_size: 3000,
    duration: '14_days'
  },
  
  character_progression_feedback: {
    hypothesis: 'More dramatic stat increase animations improve engagement',
    variants: ['subtle_feedback', 'moderate_feedback', 'dramatic_feedback'],
    primary_metric: 'session_duration',
    secondary_metrics: ['workout_logging_frequency', 'battle_participation'],
    sample_size: 2000,
    duration: '21_days'
  },
  
  social_feature_timing: {
    hypothesis: 'Earlier social feature introduction increases retention',
    variants: ['day_1_social', 'day_3_social', 'day_7_social'],
    primary_metric: 'day_30_retention',
    secondary_metrics: ['friend_connections', 'guild_participation'],
    sample_size: 5000,
    duration: '45_days'
  }
};
```

## User Segmentation Strategy
### Behavioral Segments
1. **Fitness Enthusiasts**: High workout frequency, moderate gaming engagement
2. **Gaming Perfectionists**: High battle participation, strategic character optimization
3. **Social Competitors**: Active in guilds, tournament participation
4. **Casual Users**: Sporadic engagement, needs motivation and simplification
5. **Hybrid Athletes**: Balanced fitness and gaming engagement

### Personalization Strategies
```javascript
const personalizationLogic = {
  fitness_enthusiasts: {
    content: 'Advanced workout challenges and nutrition tips',
    features: 'Detailed progress tracking and health insights',
    notifications: 'Workout reminders and achievement celebrations'
  },
  
  gaming_perfectionists: {
    content: 'Character build guides and fighting techniques',
    features: 'Advanced combat mechanics and stat optimization',
    notifications: 'New character abilities and tournament announcements'
  },
  
  social_competitors: {
    content: 'Guild challenges and leaderboard updates',
    features: 'Social sharing tools and community events',
    notifications: 'Friend achievements and guild activities'
  }
};
```

## Revenue Analytics and Optimization
### Monetization Analysis
- **Ad Revenue Optimization**: eCPM analysis by user segment and placement
- **Premium Conversion**: Feature usage patterns leading to subscription
- **Lifetime Value Modeling**: Predictive LTV based on early engagement
- **Price Sensitivity Analysis**: Willingness to pay across user segments

### Cohort Revenue Analysis
```sql
-- Monthly cohort revenue analysis
WITH monthly_cohorts AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as cohort_month,
    user_id
  FROM users
),
revenue_by_cohort AS (
  SELECT 
    mc.cohort_month,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', r.purchase_date) as revenue_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT mc.user_id) as cohort_size,
    SUM(r.amount) as revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.user_id) as paying_users
  FROM monthly_cohorts mc
  LEFT JOIN revenue r ON mc.user_id = r.user_id
  GROUP BY mc.cohort_month, DATE_TRUNC('month', r.purchase_date)
)
SELECT 
  cohort_month,
  cohort_size,
  SUM(CASE WHEN revenue_month = cohort_month THEN revenue END) as month_0_revenue,
  SUM(CASE WHEN revenue_month = cohort_month + INTERVAL '1 month' THEN revenue END) as month_1_revenue,
  SUM(CASE WHEN revenue_month = cohort_month + INTERVAL '2 months' THEN revenue END) as month_2_revenue
FROM revenue_by_cohort
GROUP BY cohort_month, cohort_size
ORDER BY cohort_month;
```
