## 🎯 Overview

16bitFit bridges the gap between nostalgic gaming and modern wellness by creating a pixel-perfect fitness companion. Inspired by classic 16-bit RPGs and Tamagotchi-style virtual pets, users nurture a retro character that directly reflects their real-world health choices.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Character Creation**: Choose from pixel-art avatars with distinct visual states
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Character's health (HP) and strength (AP) change based on your choices
- **Progression System**: Gain EXP and level up through consistent healthy habits
- **Boss Battles**: Test your character's strength against challenging opponents
- **Retro Aesthetics**: Authentic 16-bit pixel art and chiptune sound effects

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Create Your Character**: Select from 3-4 preset 16-bit avatars
2. **Feed Your Character**: Log healthy meals to boost HP and gain EXP, or see the consequences of unhealthy treats
3. **Train Your Character**: Complete workouts to increase Attack Power (AP) and EXP
4. **Level Up**: Fill the EXP bar to permanently upgrade your character's stats
5. **Fight Bosses**: Challenge opponents to test your progress and earn bonus rewards

- **Simplified Progress Tracking**: Clear stats (HP/AP/EXP) instead of overwhelming data
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Character growth directly tied to personal health improvements
