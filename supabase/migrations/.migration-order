# Migration Order for 16BitFit Database
# This file documents the correct order for running migrations

1. 20250115000000_initial_schema.sql
   - Creates core tables: user_profiles, characters, achievements, etc.
   - Sets up RLS policies
   - Creates indexes and triggers
   - Must run FIRST as other migrations depend on these tables

2. 20240721_battle_system.sql
   - Creates battle-specific tables
   - Adds battle statistics and leaderboards
   - Depends on user_profiles from initial schema

3. 20250127_realtime_matchmaking.sql
   - Adds PvP matchmaking support
   - Creates matchmaking queue
   - Adds health columns to pvp_battles
   - Depends on user_profiles and pvp_battles

4. create_leaderboards.sql
   - Creates leaderboard table and views
   - Adds weekly/monthly leaderboard views
   - Should run LAST as it may reference other tables

Note: Supabase will run these in alphabetical order by filename,
which is why we use timestamps to ensure correct ordering.
