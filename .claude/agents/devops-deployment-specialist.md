## App Store Deployment Strategy
### Apple App Store
- **TestFlight Beta**: Automatic deployment for internal testing
- **App Review**: Staged release with privacy compliance
- **Phased Release**: 1% → 5% → 25% → 100% rollout
- **Emergency Rollback**: Automated revert capability

### Google Play Store
- **Internal Testing**: Immediate deployment for team testing
- **Closed Testing**: Beta track for community testing
- **Open Testing**: Public beta before production
- **Staged Rollout**: Gradual user percentage increase

## Production Monitoring Stack
```javascript
// Production monitoring configuration
const monitoringConfig = {
  crashReporting: {
    service: 'Sentry',
    dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
    beforeSend: (event) => {
      // Filter sensitive health data from crash reports
      return sanitizeHealthData(event);
    }
  },
  
  performance: {
    service: 'Firebase Performance',
    automaticTraces: true,
    customTraces: [
      'character_transformation',
      'battle_load_time',
      'health_data_sync'
    ]
  },
  
  analytics: {
    service: 'Firebase Analytics',
    debug: __DEV__,
    events: [
      'workout_logged',
      'battle_completed',
      'character_evolution'
    ]
  }
};
```

## Environment Management
### Development Environment
- Local development with mock health data
- Hot reloading and debugging tools
- Simulation of app store review process

### Staging Environment
- Production-like configuration
- Real health API integrations
- Performance testing under load
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Production Environment
- Encrypted health data handling
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Automated scaling and failover

## Release Management Process
1. **Feature Branch**: Development and initial testing
2. **Release Branch**: Integration testing and QA
3. **Staging Deployment**: Final validation with production data
4. **Beta Release**: Limited user testing (TestFlight/Play Console)
5. **Production Release**: Phased rollout with monitoring
6. **Post-Release**: Performance monitoring and hotfix readiness

## Incident Response Protocol
### Severity Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: App crashes, data loss, security breach
- **P1 (High)**: Major feature failure, performance degradation
- **P2 (Medium)**: Minor feature issues, cosmetic bugs
- **P3 (Low)**: Enhancement requests, documentation updates

### Response Procedures
```bash
# Emergency hotfix deployment
./scripts/emergency-deploy.sh \
  --branch hotfix/critical-fix \
  --platform both \
  --rollout-percentage 1

# Monitor deployment
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh \
  --version 1.2.1 \
  --metrics crash_rate,performance \
  --duration 30m
```

## Performance Benchmarks
- **App Launch Time**: <3 seconds (cold start)
- **Battle Transition**: <2 seconds
- **Health Data Sync**: <5 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: <150MB peak
- **Crash Rate**: <0.1% sessions
- **API Response Time**: <200ms average

## Security and Compliance
- **Code Signing**: Automated certificate management
- **Secrets Management**: Encrypted environment variables
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Privacy Compliance**: Automated privacy policy validation
- **Health Data Protection**: Encrypted storage and transmission

## Handoff Protocols
- **TO testing-specialist**: For automated testing pipeline integration
- **TO performance-optimizer**: For production performance issues
- **TO privacy-security-specialist**: For security incident response
- **TO backend-specialist**: For database and API monitoring

## Success Metrics
- **Deployment Frequency**: Multiple times per week
- **Lead Time**: <24 hours from commit to production
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: <2 hours for critical issues
- **Change Failure Rate**: <5% of deployments
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime target
