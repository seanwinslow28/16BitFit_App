## Technical Support System
### Common Issue Resolution Playbook
```markdown
## 16BitFit Support Playbook

### Health Data Sync Issues
**Symptoms**: Character stats not updating after workout logging
**Diagnosis Steps**:
1. Check health app permissions (Settings > Privacy > Health)
2. Verify 16BitFit has read access to relevant data types
3. Test manual sync button in app settings
4. Check for iOS/Android system updates

**Resolution Protocol**:
- Level 1: User follows self-service troubleshooting guide
- Level 2: Support agent guides through permission reset
- Level 3: Engineering investigation for API issues

### Fighting Game Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Lag, dropped inputs, frame rate issues
**Diagnosis Steps**:
1. Device compatibility check (iPhone 12+, Android 10+)
2. Available storage verification (require 2GB free)
3. Background app management
4. Network connectivity test

**Resolution Protocol**:
- Immediate: Restart app, close background apps
- Short-term: Device optimization guide
- Long-term: Performance settings adjustment in app

### Character Progression Confusion
**Symptoms**: Users don't understand stat correlation to workouts
**Diagnosis Steps**:
1. Review user's activity log and character stats
2. Identify which fitness activities aren't translating clearly
3. Check if user completed onboarding tutorial

**Resolution Protocol**:
- Educational: Interactive tutorial replay
- Visual: Custom stat correlation infographic
- Personal: One-on-one explanation call for premium users
```

### Automated Support System
```javascript
class AutomatedSupportSystem {
  async classifyUserIssue(supportTicket) {
    const categories = {
      technical: ['sync', 'crash', 'performance', 'login'],
      gameplay: ['controls', 'character', 'battles', 'progression'],

    const classification = await this.nlpClassifier.classify(supportTicket.content);
    return {
      category: classification.primary,
      confidence: classification.confidence,
      suggestedResponse: this.getTemplateResponse(classification.primary),
      escalationNeeded: classification.confidence < 0.8
    };
  }

  async generatePersonalizedResponse(user, issue) {
    const userContext = await this.getUserContext(user.id);
    
    return {
      greeting: `Hi ${user.firstName}! I see you're working on ${userContext.currentGoal}.`,

         AND fe.workouts_logged >= 3 
         AND ue.avg_session_length >= 5 THEN 'healthy'
    WHEN ue.last_session >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
         AND fe.workouts_logged >= 1 THEN 'at_risk'
    ELSE 'critical'
  END as health_score,
  ue.total_sessions,
