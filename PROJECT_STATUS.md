# 16BitFit Project Status

## Summary
The 16BitFit project has been successfully debugged and organized. The app is a fitness tracking app with a Game Boy-inspired UI and Street Fighter 2-style battle mechanics.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Dependency Check ✅
- All npm dependencies are installed correctly
- Phaser game dependencies are installed
- No missing packages detected

### 2. Bug Fixes ✅
- Fixed RNFS import errors in PhaserWebView.js and PhaserWebViewBridge.js
- Fixed ESLint configuration issues
- Built and deployed Phaser game assets to iOS and Android directories

### 3. UI/UX Implementation ✅
- Removed incorrect GameBoy shell wrapper from screens
- Implemented clean, pixel-art inspired interface using Game Boy color palette
- Updated main tab screens: Home, Stats, Battle, Social
- All screens now match the design documentation

### 4. Project Structure ✅
- React Native app with Expo framework
- Two battle implementations available:
  - SimpleBattleGame: React Native-based (currently active)
  - PhaserWebView: WebView-based with Phaser 3 (available but not currently used)
- Proper navigation setup with React Navigation
- Supabase backend integration ready

## Current Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: React Navigation (Bottom Tabs + Stack)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Design System**: Game Boy-inspired with PressStart2P font

### Game Engine Options
1. **SimpleBattleGame** (Active): Pure React Native implementation
   - More reliable on mobile devices
   - Uses React Native animations
   - No WebView overhead

2. **PhaserWebView** (Available): Phaser 3 in WebView
   - Full fighting game engine capabilities
   - 60fps target performance
   - WebView communication bridge implemented

### Backend
- **Platform**: Supabase
- **Authentication**: Guest/Anonymous support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Real-time**: Enabled for live updates

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run the app on iOS/Android simulators to verify functionality
2. **Health Integration**: Connect Apple HealthKit (iOS) and Google Fit (Android)
3. **Battle System**: Decide between SimpleBattleGame or PhaserWebView approach
4. **Character Evolution**: Implement 5-stage evolution system
5. **Social Features**: Complete leaderboard and social functionality
